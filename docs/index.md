# Innovating the Future of Child Health with Technology & Data {style='text-align:center'}

## :health_worker: About us

### Coded by clinicians, for clinicians

We're RCPCH Tech. We are **clinicians _and_ developers** who make​ **open child health tech** you’ll want to use every day.

We merge the worlds of healthcare and technology to revolutionise child health. As the in-house development team at the [Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health](https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}, we build **best practice as code**.

### Our work

We're building a portfolio that improves Paediatric care and research, from modernising digital growth charts to building apps that make large-scale audits easier. This gives us greater input into the tools we, as clinicians, use daily. Let's work together.

- **Applications:** Intuitive and user-friendly applications tailored to meet the unique needs of paediatric healthcare, including caregivers and the patient.
- **Open Source:** This is healthcare; we believe in easy-access and the power of collaboration. Explore our open-source projects and contribute to advancing child health technology worldwide: [:fontawesome-brands-github: RCPCH Github](https://github.com/rcpch){:target="\_blank"}.
